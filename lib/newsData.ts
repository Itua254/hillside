### Turkana on the African Football Map
During the summit, Simon Logilae engaged with key figures in African football, including former Nigerian national team coach and football legend, Sunday Oliseh. Their discussions centered on the economic impact of football, strategies for developing grassroots talent, and the role of local clubs in shaping the future of the sport.

For Turkana, this representation at a continental level is a significant step forward. Traditionally underrepresented in national and international football conversations, our region is now making strides towards being recognized as a growing football hub.

### Football as a Tool for Economic Empowerment
One of the central themes of the summit was the power of football in economic empowerment. Across Africa, the sport has created opportunities for young people, provided employment, and driven investment in local communities. By strengthening grassroots football, regions like Turkana can develop local talent, attract sponsorships, and create sustainable football programs that benefit both players and the community at large.

Simon Logilae, a passionate advocate for sports development, reinforced this message in his address:
> “Let’s support our teams, invest in young talent, and push for a brighter future through sports. Together, we score goals on and off the field.”

His words serve as a call to action for local businesses, government officials, and football stakeholders to invest in the sport and unlock its full potential for economic and social transformation.

### Hillside FC’s Commitment to Growth
As Division 2 champions now competing in Division 1 of the Kenya Premier League, Hillside FC is a shining example of how grassroots football can drive change. The club remains dedicated to developing young talent, promoting sportsmanship, and positioning Turkana as a football powerhouse.

With the continued leadership of Simon Logilae and support from the community, we believe that Turkana football is on the path to greatness.
